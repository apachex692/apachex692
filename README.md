# Anumand Sakthi Santhosh

Engineering is more than a job to me—it’s a “_responsibility_”. I take pride in building systems that are efficient, reliable, sustainable and built to last.

I work across the stack—analog/digital electronics, embedded systems, back-end engineering, and cloud infrastructure—because I want to understand how everything fits together.

My end goal is clear: to be _responsible_ for building a massive system that can serve billions of users concurrently.

More than anything, I want to look back one day and feel proud—not of titles or tech, but of the care I put into my work and the people it helped. If that resonates with you, I’d love to connect.
